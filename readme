1. This program takes the Array List of inputs in the form of Pin code start and end range which are restricted and normalizes the different ranges into fewer range.
2. Approach taken here is to sort the user input pin code ranges based on their lower bound so that merging becomes easier.
3. I take sorted list as input and keep adding the independent range (which doesnt overlap with other ranges) and merging the overlapping ranges into 1 range.
4. Time complexity of this program is O (N log N) (to sort and merge the results) and a space complexity of O(1) for the space since we are using the same List to merge the
5. Run UnitTestPinCodeMerge class to run the program by hardcoding the ranges in the program and run MergeRestrictedPinRange to accept the range as user input.
